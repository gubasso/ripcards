# Leitner System

> Spaced repetition method

The Leitner system is a powerful and efficient method for learning and memorizing information using flashcards and spaced repetition. Developed by German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s, it remains a highly effective study technique today. Here's a detailed look at how it works:

## Overview

The core idea is to sort flashcards into different boxes or levels based on how well you know each card. Cards you answer correctly move up to higher levels and are reviewed less frequently, while cards you struggle with stay in the lower levels and are studied more often. This optimizes your learning by focusing your time and effort on your weak areas.

## Setup

1. Create flashcards with a question or prompt on one side and the answer on the back. Use a separate card for each fact or concept you want to learn.

2. Get 3-5 physical boxes or digital equivalents in a flashcard app. Label them Box 1, Box 2, Box 3, etc. 

3. All cards start off in Box 1 for daily review. Set up a schedule for reviewing each box at increasing intervals, such as:

- Box 1: Every day 
- Box 2: Every 2-3 days
- Box 3: Once per week
- Box 4: Every 2 weeks
- Box 5: Once per month

## Studying and Moving Cards

When you review cards in a box, move them between boxes based on how well you know them:

- If you answer a card correctly, promote it to the next box (e.g. from Box 1 to Box 2).
- If you answer a card incorrectly, demote it back to Box 1 for more frequent study.

Cards you know well will quickly advance to the higher boxes, while difficult cards will get reviewed often in Box 1 until you master them. Eventually, cards you've fully memorized will reach the last box and "graduate".

## Why It Works

The Leitner system leverages several effective learning principles:

- **Active recall**: By testing yourself with flashcards, you actively retrieve information from memory, which strengthens your ability to recall it in the future.[2] [3]

- **Spaced repetition**: Reviewing information at increasing time intervals has been shown to produce stronger long-term retention compared to cramming.[1] [2] 

- **Focused effort**: By quickly sorting out cards you already know well, the Leitner system enables you to concentrate your study time on your weak areas for rapid improvement.[1] [3]

The Leitner system is highly versatile and can be customized to your needs. You can use more or fewer boxes, adjust the review intervals, and combine it with other study techniques. Whether you use physical flashcards or digital equivalents like Anki, the Leitner system is a potent tool for mastering any subject.
