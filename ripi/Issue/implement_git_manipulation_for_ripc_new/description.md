# implement_git_manipulation_for_ripc_new (Issue)

- each file manipulation must be in functions that will call git
  - ripc init is integrated with git?
  - ripc new is integrated with git?

- write -> write_file_content

- review handle_new_card
  - identify the relative_path from the root as the card_id

- [x] create_dir_all -> create_directory
- [x] test get_relative_path
